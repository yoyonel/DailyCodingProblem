"""
I.
Find the largest rectangular area possible in a given histogram where the largest rectangle can be made of a number of contiguous bars.
For simplicity, assume that all bars have same width and the width is 1 unit.

For example, consider the following histogram with 7 bars of heights {6, 2, 5, 4, 5, 1, 6}.
The largest possible rectangle possible is 12 (see the below figure, the max area rectangle is highlighted in red)

II.
Given a binary matrix, find the maximum size rectangle binary-sub-matrix with all 1â€™s.

Input :   0 1 1 0
          1 1 1 1
          1 1 1 1
          1 1 0 0

Output :  1 1 1 1
          1 1 1 1
