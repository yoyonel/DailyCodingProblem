Longest Consecutive Sequence In An Array - Coding Interview on Whiteboard Thursday

```
Given an array of integers,
find the length of the longest sub-sequence such that elements in the subsequence are consecutive integers,
the consecutive numbers can be in any order.

Examples

Input: arr[] = {1, 9, 3, 10, 4, 20, 2};
Output: 4
The subsequence 1, 3, 4, 2 is the longest subsequence
of consecutive elements

Input: arr[] = {36, 41, 56, 35, 44, 33, 34, 92, 43, 32, 42}
Output: 5
The subsequence 36, 35, 33, 34, 32 is the longest subsequence
of consecutive elements.
